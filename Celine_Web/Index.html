                    <p> Céline Dion was born on March 30, 1968, in Charlemagne, Québec, a little town 50 kilometers from Montréal. She was the 14th child of Thérèse Tanguay and Adhémar Dion. The Dion family was a humble one of modest means, but never lacked for love. The house was jam-packed with children, and Céline’s mom even had to lay her littlest one to sleep in a drawer.</p>

                    <p>After over 35 years as a performing and recording artist, Céline Dion has become a legend of popular music, one of the most powerful and moving voices ever heard. According to a poll conducted by international market research firm YouGov, she is the 6th most admired woman on the planet. And the source of that admiration is the life as much as the work, the music. An honest woman who sings from the heart. It’s as simple and true as that – as simple and true as Céline.</p>
